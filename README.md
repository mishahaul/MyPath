# MyPath
Create a program that finds all the shortest paths between all the islands, using informationabout the bridges that connect them. The program:
  •reads data from a file. Its name is specified as a command-line argument
  •finds all the shortest paths between each combination of two islands
  •prints the paths using the FIFO (first) rule for the islands to the standard output.More examples can be found in the CONSOLE OUTPUT
Input file description:
  •the first line in the file is the number of islands
  •the remaining lines describe the distance between the two islands, one per line. Each line consists of two islands, 
  the length of the bridge between them and a newline in a format:
  island1-island2,length_of_bridge:
    –the names of the islands contain only alphabetic characters and cannot be emptyor identical
    –the length of the bridge contains only numbers, cannot be empty and has a positivevalue
    –the sum of the lengths of all bridges in the file does not exceed INT_MAX
The output consists of information blocks about a specific shortest path. Each block contains:
•========================================- the upper boundary that consists of 40=  characters
•Path: <island1> -> <island2>that shows the initial point and the final destination
•Route: <island1> -> <all_islands_between> -> <island2>that shows the full routebetween the two islands
•Distance: <length1> + <length2> = <sum>that shows the distance between everyisland in the route, 
as well as their sum that indicates the distance to the final destination
•========================================- the bottom boundary that consists of 40=  characters
Error handling. The program prints errors to the standard error streamstderrin thefollowing order of priority:
  •usage: ./pathfinder [filename]if there is an invalid number of command-line arguments
  •error: file [filename] does not existif the file does not exist
  •error: file [filename] is emptyif the file is empty
  •error: line 1 is not validif the first line contains something other than digits orhas a non-positive value
  •error: line [line_number] is not validif one of the remaining lines does not matchthe format above
  •error: invalid number of islandsif the number received in the first line does notmatch with the number of islands
  •error: duplicate bridgesif there is more than one bridge between the islands
  •error: sum of bridges lengths is too bigif the sum of the lengths of all bridges inthe file exceeds INT_MAX
